title: "Negotiating Faith and Gender: Womenâ€™s Roles in Early Christianity "

As many of us might know about early Christianity regarding the apostles such as Paul, Peter and more, women from this time often go unrecognized, But the truth is that the active participation of women in the early church was made impossible due to the toxic masculinity in that era.  women were far more than spectators, they were discoverers and leaders, educators and pioneers, creating a growing faith in a world surrounded by masculine cultural and religious norms. While their experiences are rarely documented directly, they are revealed via layers of history and customs that hide their function. It is important to explore women's roles and how their subjection influenced Christianity, as well as how their creative resistance left a lasting impact on the foundation of the church.
