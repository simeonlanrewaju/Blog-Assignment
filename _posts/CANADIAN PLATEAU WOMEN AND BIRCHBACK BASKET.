The birchbark basket is a sacred and practical object that carries deep spiritual and cultural significance within the Canadian Plateau women community, traditionally crafted from the bark of the birch tree and made by women. The birchbark basket is more than just a utilitarian object; it is imbued with spiritual meaning as it plays a crucial role in religious practices and rituals. The techniques of making birch bark basketry were learned and passed on from one generation of women to the next (Croft and Mathewes,2013, p.100), I think it is essential to teach these skills to their generation because the process of making a basket requires both physical and spiritual knowledge as it requires both practical skill and spiritual knowledge.
The ritual benefit of birchbark basket is depicted in burials and transitioning of young girls to womanhood. For burial, it is used to hold food, for the afterlife of the individual, and has an offering to spirits ( Croft and Mathewes,2013, p.104) as highlighted by Croft and Mathewes that since women made birch bark containers, it can be suggested that placing these containers with the dead was a way of providing the deceased with the nurturing presence of women (2013,p.104), this can suggest that the basket may be a symbol of female nurturing.  The learning the craft of birch basket construction was part of a girl’s tran¬sition into what it meant to be a woman both socially and economically; it was also part of her spiritual development. (Croft and Mathewes,2013, p.106) because the knowledge of the basket is essential to the development of her community.
The birchbark basket is deeply connected to the authority and power of women in Canadian Plateau women culture. The making and use of the basket is primarily a female responsibility, and through this role, Canadian Plateau women assert their spiritual authority. The birchbark basket represents women’s role as caretakers and sustainers of both physical and spiritual life.  women wield considerable power, particularly in matters of passing down of traditional knowledge about the birchbark and its different use for the community.
Conclusively, the birchbark basket in the Canadian Plateau community is more than just a practical tool; it is a sacred object that reflects the spiritual relationship between women, and the community. Its creation and use are deeply connected to the authority of women as caretakers, and spiritual leaders. Through their skilled craftsmanship and spiritual knowledge, Canadian Plateau women use the birchbark basket to nurture both the physical and spiritual well-being of her community.
